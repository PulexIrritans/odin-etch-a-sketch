This was all about practicing DOM manipulation on various inputs. 

I managed to find the solution for the core functionality really quick.

The biggest challenge was when the "pen" wouldn't work after usage of the slider.
I learned that I had to add the event listeners to the items again as the above function would clear all grid items and add them anew.

For the first time I also tried to make the UI really pretty.
Still facing some challenges when it comes to position items as I want.
Also, I want to learn more about responsive design.
